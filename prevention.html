        <h2>Prevention of Air pollution</h2>
        <p>Air pollution can be defined as the contamination of the atmosphere with anomalous concentrations of substances that are harmful to the health of human beings and other organisms. Typical examples of air pollutants include sulfur dioxide, carbon monoxide, nitrous oxides, ammonia, chlorofluorocarbons (often abbreviated to CFCs), and methane. Air pollution is a serious environmental concern since it can cause several diseases in human beings, some even resulting in death. Therefore, the prevention of air pollution is very important. Air pollution is also known to have an adverse impact on a wide spectrum of life forms including crops and animals. It can be noted that air pollution can occur due to natural processes or human activity, the latter being more predominant (air pollution caused by human activity is generally referred to as anthropogenic air pollution).</p>
<h3>What are Air Pollutants?</h3>
<p>Any material that is present in the environment and can have harmful effects on human beings and the ecosystem can be categorized as an air pollutant. Air pollutants can assume the form of particulate matter, gaseous substances, and droplets that exist in the liquid state. Such pollutants can be of natural or man-made origin. Air pollutants are generally categorized as secondary or primary pollutants. Natural processes (such as the ash produced from a volcanic eruption) typically create primary contaminants. The sulphur dioxide emitted from factories or the carbon monoxide gas produced from motor vehicle exhausts are other examples of primary contaminants.

Secondary contaminants do not enter the atmosphere from direct emissions. Instead, as primary contaminants react or communicate, they form secondary contaminants in the atmosphere. An important example of a secondary pollutant is ground-level ozone. Some contaminants can be both primary and secondary: both directly emitted from natural or anthropogenic activity or produced from other primary pollutants.</p>
<h3>How can Air Pollution be Prevented?</h3>
<p>Some important measures that can be adopted by individuals to contribute towards the prevention of air pollution have been listed below.</p>
        <ul>
		<li><h3>Usage of public transport and carpooling –</h3></li>
		    <ul>by reducing the amount of fuel combusted for an individual’s transportation needs, he/she can lower the amount of pollutants being released into the atmosphere and cause less air pollution. Furthermore, these options are also economically efficient and can help save money as well.</ul>
		<li><h3>Switching off the lights when they’re not in use –</h3></li>
		    <ul>the majority of our electricity is produced from the combustion of fossil fuels, which are a huge contributor towards air pollution. Therefore, conserving electricity is an effective way of preventing air pollution.</ul>
		<li><h3>Reusing and recycling products –</h3></li>
		    <ul>By reusing products (that can be reused), the amount of energy that goes into manufacturing another one of those products is conserved. Furthermore, recycling of products is also more energy-efficient than the manufacture of new ones.</ul>
		<li><h3>Avoiding the burning of garbage and smoking –</h3></li>
                    <ul>burning of garbage is a huge contributor to air pollution. Another contributor to air pollution is cigarette smoking. Avoiding these activities and spreading awareness of their negative consequences can be of great help in the prevention of air pollution.</ul>
                 <li><h3>Avoiding the use of firecrackers –</h3></li>
                     <ul>firecrackers are generally used to celebrate certain occasions. However, they are known to cause severe air pollution and are, therefore, extremely harmful to the environment. Personally avoiding the use of firecrackers and spreading awareness about their negative consequences is a great way to help prevent air pollution.</ul>
