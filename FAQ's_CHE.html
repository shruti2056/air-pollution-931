        <h2>Common Questions</h2>
        <div class="faq-item">
            <div class="faq-question">Q: How does air pollution affect my health and the health of my family?</div>
            <div class="faq-answer">A: Depending on the length of time you are exposed, your health status, your genetic background and the concentration of pollutants, air pollution can have a negative effect on your heart and lungs.Each individual reacts differently to air pollution.  Children, the elderly and those with diabetes, heart or lung disease are most sensitive to the adverse health effects of air pollution.

Negative health effects increase as air pollution worsens.  Studies have shown that even modest increases in air pollution can cause small but measurable increases in emergency room visits, hospital admissions and death.  Small increases in air pollution over a short period of time can increase symptoms of pre-existing illness among those at risk.</div>

        <div class="faq-item">
            <div class="faq-question">Q: What is the Air Quality Health Index (AQHI)?</div>
            <div class="faq-answer">A: The Air Quality Health Index is a scale designed to help you understand what the quality of the air around you means to your health.  It is a tool developed by health and environmental professionals to communicate the health risk posed by air pollution.</div>
        </div>
<div class="faq-item">
            <div class="faq-question">Q: How is the Air Quality Health Index presented?</div>
            <div class="faq-answer">A: The Air Quality Health Index is a scale that lists a number from 1 to 10+ to indicate the level of health risk associated with air quality. 

Scientists created the index by estimating the daily change in mortality risk for ten cities from 1998-2000 and plotting it on a 10 point scale.

The higher the number, the greater the risk and the need to take precautions. </div>

        <div class="faq-item">
            <div class="faq-question">Q: What is the difference between the community AQHI value and the individual station observation?</div>
            <div class="faq-answer">A: The Air Quality Health Index (AQHI) is based on measurements of air quality from monitoring stations across Canada. For most communities, the AQHI value is produced by averaging information from the air monitoring stations in the local area. This average community value is provided for the locations on the provincial map. AQHI values from the individual air monitoring stations are provided in the accompanying list.</div>
